# Chat bot

This project is a simple chat bot made with Python, and OpenAI-API. Currently
the AI assistant only responds in a very rude manner.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+, pip, OpenAI API key set as environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY
- Script uses Nerd Font icons, so for best experience, use on a terminal with
  Nerd Font patched font

## Getting started

- clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tvntvn13/openai-chatbot.git
```

- set up and activate Virtual Environment

```bash
cd openai-chatbot
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

- install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- now you can run the script

```bash
./chat/chat.py
```

- to exit the program you can press `ctrl+d`, `crtl-c`, write `q`,`quit`,`exit`
  or `close`

### Model

- the program currently uses the **gpt-3.5-turbo** -model, so it's not very
  expensive to play around with

### Enjoy
